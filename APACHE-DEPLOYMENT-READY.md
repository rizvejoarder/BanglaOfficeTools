## ⚙️ APACHE SERVER REQUIREMENTS

### Essential Apache Modules (Usually enabled by default)
- ✅ **mod_rewrite** - For React routing
- ✅ **mod_headers** - For security headers  
- ✅ **mod_deflate** - For compression
- ✅ **mod_expires** - For caching
- ✅ **mod_mime** - For file types

### Verify modules are enabled:
```bash
# On your Apache server, run:
apache2ctl -M | grep -E "(rewrite|headers|deflate|expires|mime)"
```

## 🔧 STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT

### Step 1: Build the Application

# In your project directory
npm run build
```

2. **Navigate to your document root** (usually `/public_html/` or `/var/www/html/`)
3. **Upload ALL contents** from the `dist/` folder
4. **Ensure .htaccess is uploaded** and readable

### Step 3: Set File Permissions (If using SSH)
```bash

chmod -R 644 /path/to/your/site/*
chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/site/*/

# Ensure .htaccess is readable
chmod 644 /path/to/your/site/.htaccess
```

### Step 4: Configure API Keys (Optional)

nano .env
```

#### 2. CSS/JS not loading
**Problem**: Styles or scripts don't load
**Solution**: Check file permissions and MIME types in Apache config

#### 3. Bengali fonts not showing
**Problem**: Bengali text shows as squares
**Solution**: Ensure font files are uploaded and accessible

#### 4. AI features not working  
**Problem**: AI chat doesn't respond
**Solution**: Add API keys to `.env` file (optional feature)

#### 5. File upload not working
**Problem**: Can't upload files
